**Problem Link**: https://www.codechef.com/problems/SAMPLE_PROBLEM  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Contest**: Practice  

## Problem Statement

Given two integers A and B, find their sum.

### Input Format
- First line contains T, the number of test cases
- Each of the next T lines contains two integers A and B

### Output Format
For each test case, output A + B

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000

## Approach

This is a straightforward problem that requires:
1. Reading the number of test cases
2. For each test case, reading two integers
3. Computing and outputting their sum

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(T) where T is the number of test cases
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
